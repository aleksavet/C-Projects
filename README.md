# C-Projects

 *Project 1*: File Data Processor in C

In this project, I built a C application to handle and process data from a text file. Here’s a quick rundown of the techniques used:

**File Handling**: Utilized C functions (`fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fscanf()`, `fprintf()`) to read and write data from the file.
**Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Used `malloc()` to manage memory for records of varying sizes.
**String Manipulation**: Applied functions like `fgets()`, `strcpy()`, and `strcspn()` to handle and clean text input.
**Structures**: Leveraged C structs to organize data fields such as names, IDs, and dates for easy management.
**Linked List**: Employed a singly linked list to store and navigate through records, allowing for flexible addition and removal of data.

*Project 2*: Data Management System in C
This project involves creating a C application for managing and manipulating structured data. Here’s a snapshot of the techniques used:

**File Handling**: Used `fopen()`, `fclose()`, and `fscanf()` to read data from a text file, structured with specific delimiters.
**Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Employed `malloc()` to handle variable-sized records dynamically.
**String and Character Manipulation**: Applied functions like `fgets()`, `strcpy()`, and `strcspn()` for effective text handling and cleaning.
**Structures**: Utilized C structs to manage data fields such as IDs, names, modules, and values.
**Linked List**: Implemented a singly linked list to store and traverse records, supporting dynamic data management.
**Sorting and Searching**: Incorporated bubble sort to organize records by date and time and various search functions to locate and manipulate specific entries.
The system supports operations like adding, viewing, deleting, sorting, and filtering records based on user input, making it a comprehensive tool for data management.
