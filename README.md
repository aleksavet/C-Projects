# C-Projects

## Project 1:Data Management System in C
This C application manages and processes structured data using **arrays**. It demonstrates proficiency in C programming concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, file handling, data validation, and sorting algorithms.
Features
### **Dynamic Memory Management**:
Utilizes malloc and realloc for dynamic memory allocation, ensuring efficient use of resources.
### **File Handling**:
Reads from and writes to files using fopen, fscanf, fprintf, and fclose, handling various data formats and ensuring data integrity.
### **Data Validation**: 
Implements validation routines to ensure data correctness, including checks for valid IDs, modules, data types, and timestamps.
### **Sorting and Filtering**:
Uses bubble sort to order data based on specific criteria and filters data according to user inputs.
### **Memory Cleanup**:
Frees dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks, demonstrating good memory management practices.


## Project 2: Data Management System in C
This project is a data logger management system implemented in C. It provides functionalities for managing and processing a linked list of data records, which are read from a file and stored in a **dynamically allocated data structure**. The system supports various operations, including data entry, retrieval, sorting, deletion, and reporting.

### **File Handling**:
Used `fopen()`, `fclose()`, and `fscanf()` to read data from a text file, structured with specific delimiters.
### **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:
Employed `malloc()` to handle variable-sized records dynamically.
### **String and Character Manipulation**:
Applied functions like `fgets()`, `strcpy()`, and `strcspn()` for effective text handling and cleaning.
### **Structures**:
Utilized C structs to manage data fields such as IDs, names, modules, and values.
### **Linked List**:
Implemented a singly linked list to store and traverse records, supporting dynamic data management.
### **Sorting and Searching**:
Incorporated bubble sort to organize records by date and time and various search functions to locate and manipulate specific entries.
